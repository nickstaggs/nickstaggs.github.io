I am a software engineer with a focus in Kotlin, C# and Typescripy/Javascript programming languages and utilizing them build web applications in the cloud. However, I am not afraid to learn something new and to use the right tool for the job.

I love to be challenged every day; I am constantly pushing myself in and out of work to learn the art and intricacies of programming. I aim to write the most orthogonal, readable, and extensible code in order for a project to be easily maintainable and scalable for years to come.

I have a very even keel and level headed approach to software and people that helps facilitate cooperation within and across development teams. I believe I create a calming force within a team as it is very hard to rattle me even when the pressures of deadlines are being felt.

I enjoy building software projects in my spare time such as my NYC taxi map project and Service Bus CLI. I also love to learn new technologies and languages in my spare time such as the numerous Javascript frontend frameworks, Golang, and Docker. If I am not nose deep doing one of the above you can find me surfing, playing soccer, or supporting the best football club in the world, Liverpool Football Club.
